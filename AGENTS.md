# Agent Instructions

Welcome, agent. This repository manages development and deep research tasks.

**Before committing any work:** You MUST review and abide by the checks defined in [PRE_COMMIT.md](./PRE_COMMIT.md).

## Folder Management & Workflow Drift

You MUST abide by the rules defined in [FOLDERS.md](./FOLDERS.md).

**Preventing Workflow Drift:** To prevent this repository's protocols from slowly drifting out of sync with reality, you are required to document your assumptions. If you assumed a certain file should be JSON instead of Markdown, or if you assumed a specific subfolder was unnecessary, you MUST log that assumption in the relevant folder's `readme.md`. This ensures human operators and future agents understand *why* the repository looks the way it does.

## Mandatory Frustration Feedback

We rely on your honest feedback to improve these protocols. You MUST consult [FRUSTRATED.md](./FRUSTRATED.md) to accurately log the Frustration Level (FL) associated with your task. **This is a mandatory step for every session, even if everything went perfectly (FL0).**

## Task Type Routing

Three top-level governance specs partition the work this repository performs. Pick the one that matches your request *before* writing any file:

| If the request is… | Consult | Operational directory |
|---|---|---|
| Coordination/orchestration with a goal, plan, and todo | [TASK.md](./TASK.md) | [/tasks/](./tasks/) |
| Authoring an executable instruction set (research proposal, follow-up, tool instruction, task-spec) | [PROMPT.md](./PROMPT.md) | [/prompts/](./prompts/) |
| Executing a prompt to produce evidence, synthesis, reflection, output | [RESEARCH.md](./RESEARCH.md) | [/research/](./research/) |

**Separation of concerns is hard:** a Task MUST link to its prompt (never inline it); research MUST NOT contain prompt drafts; follow-up questions discovered during research MUST be filed as new prompts in `/prompts/`. The full audit-graph rules and Frontmatter Ontology (Layered Schema with Namespacing) live in [TASK.md §3](./TASK.md).

## Spec Language Reference

Every agent in this repository MUST speak a shared formal language when writing normative specifications, acceptance criteria, or governance rules. This section defines that language. The **canonical, complete definitions** live in [`/maintenance/language-spec.md`](./maintenance/language-spec.md). The rules below are the authoritative binding summary every agent must internalize before writing any spec.

### RFC 2119 Normative Keywords

The key words **MUST**, **MUST NOT**, **REQUIRED**, **SHALL**, **SHALL NOT**, **SHOULD**, **SHOULD NOT**, **RECOMMENDED**, **NOT RECOMMENDED**, **MAY**, and **OPTIONAL** in this repository are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14 \[RFC 2119\] \[RFC 8174\] **when, and only when, they appear in all capitals**.

#### Quick Reference

| Keyword | Strength | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| MUST / REQUIRED / SHALL | Absolute | No deviation permitted under any circumstances. |
| MUST NOT / SHALL NOT | Absolute prohibition | The behaviour is never allowed. |
| SHOULD / RECOMMENDED | Strong default | Deviation allowed only with documented justification. |
| SHOULD NOT / NOT RECOMMENDED | Strong discouragement | Deviation allowed only with documented justification. |
| MAY / OPTIONAL | Permissive | Fully at the implementer's discretion. |

#### Usage Rules

- **R1.** Every normative statement MUST use exactly one RFC 2119 keyword per sentence.
- **R2.** Rationale paragraphs, motivation text, and prose explanations MUST NOT contain RFC 2119 keywords in uppercase. Lowercase "should" or "may" in prose is permitted.
- **R3.** Each normative statement SHOULD be addressable by a stable identifier of the form `<Spec-Letter>.<Section>.<Index>` (e.g., `A.3.2`), so that cross-references and audit logs can pin-point the exact clause.
- **R4.** A spec file MUST include a verbatim `§ RFC 2119` declaration section before its first normative clause (see `/maintenance/language-spec.md` for the canonical boilerplate).

### Gherkin Syntax Binding

Every behavioural example, agent-interaction scenario, or hand-off specification in every produced spec MUST use standard Gherkin syntax and MUST be self-contained and executable.

#### Keywords

| Keyword | Role |
|---|---|
| `Feature:` | Names the capability under test. Every Gherkin block must be nested inside a Feature. |
| `Background:` | Shared setup steps applied to every Scenario in the Feature. OPTIONAL; RECOMMENDED when ≥ 3 scenarios share the same Given setup. |
| `Scenario:` | A single, named behavioural example. |
| `Scenario Outline:` | A parametric scenario template. MUST be paired with an `Examples:` table. RECOMMENDED when the same behavioural shape repeats with varying inputs. |
| `Given` | Establishes pre-conditions. At least one Given MUST appear in every Scenario. |
| `When` | Describes the triggering action or event. At least one When MUST appear in every Scenario. |
| `Then` | States the expected observable outcome. At least one Then MUST appear in every Scenario. |
| `And` / `But` | Continuation of the immediately preceding `Given`, `When`, or `Then`. MUST NOT be used as the first step in a Scenario. |

#### Validity Rules

- **G1.** Every `Scenario` block MUST contain at least one `Given`, at least one `When`, and at least one `Then`.
- **G2.** `And` and `But` MUST follow a `Given`, `When`, or `Then` — never open a scenario.
- **G3.** A scenario MUST be **self-contained**: it MUST NOT reference external context that is not also defined within the same spec file.
- **G4.** A scenario MUST be **executable**: a human or agent reading it MUST be able to enact every step without additional clarification.
- **G5.** Each `Scenario` SHOULD carry an anchor comment on the line immediately above it: `# anchor: <stable-id>`. This enables cross-referencing from prose.
- **G6.** Acceptance criteria in this repository MUST be written as Gherkin scenarios, not as bullet-list assertions.

#### Minimal Valid Example

```gherkin
Feature: Agent picks up an open Task

  # anchor: T.6.1
  Scenario: Agent claims a task before writing
    Given a file "/tasks/003-example/task.md" exists
    And its frontmatter field "task_status" is "open"
    When an agent decides to work on the task
    Then the agent MUST set "task_status" to "in_progress" before any other write
    And the agent MUST set "task_owner" to its own identifier
    And the agent MUST update "updated" to today's ISO-8601 date
```

## Frontmatter Ontology (Summary)

Every Markdown file in this repository SHOULD carry frontmatter. Files inside operational directories (`/tasks/`, `/prompts/`, `/research/`) MUST carry frontmatter. The schema is a **Layered Schema with Namespacing** derived from `research/obsidian-frontmatter-agentic-spec/output/SPEC.md` and canonically defined in [TASK.md §3](./TASK.md).

### Layer Overview

| Layer | Scope | Mandate |
|---|---|---|
| **L0** — Obsidian Reserved | `tags`, `aliases`, `cssclasses` | Optional; preserved if present. |
| **L1** — Vault Core | `type`, `status`, `slug`, `summary`, `created`, `updated` | MUST be present on all operational files. |
| **L2** — Domain Namespace | `task_*`, `prompt_*`, `research_*` keys | MUST be present inside the directory that owns the namespace. |
| **L3** — Agent-Only | Vector embeddings, graph scores, token matrices | MUST NOT appear in YAML. Lives in `/.agent_cache/<file>.meta.json`. |

### L1 Field Semantics

| Key | Type | Agent Guidance |
|---|---|---|
| `type` | string | One of: `task`, `prompt`, `research`, `spec`, `readme`, `note`, `index`. Drives parser routing — read this first. |
| `status` | string | One of: `draft`, `active`, `blocked`, `completed`, `archived`. Archived files MAY be skipped by the agent to save tokens. |
| `slug` | string | Kebab-case; MUST match the enclosing folder name where applicable. |
| `summary` | string | Token-cheap tl;dr. The agent SHOULD read `summary` before opening the body. This is the primary token-saving lever in the repo. |
| `created` | date | ISO-8601 (`YYYY-MM-DD`). Set once at creation; never update. |
| `updated` | date | ISO-8601 (`YYYY-MM-DD`). MUST be updated on every substantive change. |

### YAML Depth Rule

YAML frontmatter MUST NOT nest beyond one level. Lists MUST contain scalars or short strings only. This is a hard constraint to prevent LLM YAML-parsing hallucinations.

The complete ontology with all L2 namespaces and worked examples lives in [TASK.md §3](./TASK.md). The Obsidian-native reasoning behind this design is in [`research/obsidian-frontmatter-agentic-spec/output/SPEC.md`](./research/obsidian-frontmatter-agentic-spec/output/SPEC.md).

## Gherkin Scenarios (Normative) — Agent Behaviour

```gherkin
Feature: Agent reads a file before acting

  Background:
    Given the agent is operating inside this repository
    And the repository root contains AGENTS.md, TASK.md, PROMPT.md, RESEARCH.md

  # anchor: AG.1.1
  Scenario: Agent reads summary before body
    Given a Markdown file exists with a non-empty "summary" frontmatter field
    When the agent needs to understand that file's purpose
    Then the agent MUST read the "summary" field first
    And the agent SHOULD open the file body only if the summary is insufficient

  # anchor: AG.1.2
  Scenario: Agent skips archived files
    Given a Markdown file has frontmatter "status: archived"
    When the agent is scanning the repository for actionable work
    Then the agent MAY skip reading the body of that file
    And the agent MUST NOT modify an archived file without first updating its status

  # anchor: AG.2.1
  Scenario: Agent selects task type before writing
    Given the agent has received a work request
    When the agent determines the request type
    Then if it is coordination work the agent MUST consult TASK.md before creating any file
    And if it is instruction-set authoring the agent MUST consult PROMPT.md before creating any file
    And if it is evidence-gathering the agent MUST consult RESEARCH.md before creating any file

  # anchor: AG.3.1
  Scenario: Agent adds frontmatter to every new operational file
    Given the agent is creating a new file inside /tasks/, /prompts/, or /research/
    When the agent writes the file
    Then the agent MUST include L1 Vault Core frontmatter
    And the agent MUST include the L2 namespace appropriate to the directory
    And the YAML MUST NOT nest deeper than one level
```

- What changed: Added explicit Schema-Gap Hypothesis for "Failure Recovery / Error Handling" to both logs.
- Verification: PASS
- Next candidate (if known): Multiple RFC 2119 keywords in single normative statements.

### Iteration 2 — 2026-05-02
- Dimension targeted: Convention
- What was wrong: Did not explicitly verify the "exactly one RFC 2119 keyword per sentence" rule.
- What changed: Ran python script to verify constraint; found 0 violations, proving existing compliance.
- Verification: PASS
- Next candidate (if known): Pre-Commitments not explicitly listed outside of scratchpad logs.

### Iteration 3 — 2026-05-02
- Dimension targeted: Completeness
- What was wrong: Pre-Commitments were not explicitly visible in the final deliverable.
- What changed: Added explicit Pre-Commitments for Spec-A, Spec-B, and Spec-C to the Methodology Note in SPEC.md.
- Verification: PASS
- Next candidate (if known): none identified

### Iteration 4 — 2026-05-02
- Dimension targeted: Correctness
- What was wrong: Literal `\n` characters in AGENTS.md and invalid Gherkin syntax due to floating `Given` statements outside `Scenario`.
- What changed: Replaced literal `\n` with newlines in AGENTS.md and inlined the `Given` steps into the Scenario in `SPEC.md`.
- Verification: PASS
- Next candidate (if known): none identified

### Iteration 5 — 2026-05-02

- What changed: Replaced the pseudocode script logic section with a fully formatted ASCII flowchart.
- Verification: PASS
- Next candidate: Missing "Abstraction Axis" in the Adversarial Query Expansion passes (M13).

### Iteration 2 — 2026-05-02
- Dimension targeted: Completeness
- What was wrong: The M13 Query Expansion passes missed the "Abstraction Axis", meaning only 3 of the 4 explicitly mandated axes were executed.
- What changed: Added the Abstraction Axis query expansion to methodology.md and to the Query Expansion Log in SPEC.md.
- Verification: PASS
- Next candidate: none identified

### Iteration 3 — 2026-05-02
- Dimension targeted: Completeness
- What was wrong: The Python pseudocode block was accidentally removed from SPEC.md when the ASCII diagram was added in Iteration 1.
- What changed: Restored the Python pseudocode block to sit alongside the ASCII diagram in SPEC.md.
- Verification: PASS
- Next candidate: none identified
